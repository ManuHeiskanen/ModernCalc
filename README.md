# ModernCalc for macOS

A powerful, modern calculator for macOS with history, variable support, and live evaluation.


## Download & Installation

1.  **[Download the latest version from the Releases page](https://github.com/ManuHeiskanen/ModernCalc/releases/tag/1.0.0)**
2.  Unzip the downloaded file.
3.  Drag `ModernCalc.app` into your **Applications** folder.

### How to Open the App for the First Time

Because this app is distributed for free outside the App Store, you will need to follow these steps the first time you open it:

1.  **Right-click** (or Control-click) on the `ModernCalc.app` icon in your Applications folder.
2.  Select **"Open"** from the menu that appears.
3.  A warning dialog will still appear, but it will now have an "Open" button. Click the **"Open"** button.

You only need to do this once. After that, you can open the app normally.

## Features

* Live result preview as you type
* Full calculation history
* Variable and function definitions (`x := 5`, `f(x) := x^2`)
* Support for complex numbers, vectors, and matrices
* LaTeX export for your equations
