# ModernCalc for macOS


An elegant, powerful, and modern scientific calculator for macOS built with SwiftUI. Go beyond basic arithmetic with live results, persistent custom variables, multi-argument functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and more.
(Pro-tip: Consider creating a short GIF of the app in action to showcase the live evaluation and history navigation. You can use a free tool like GIPHY Capture.)

## ‚ú® Features

Live Evaluation: See your results instantly as you type. No need to press "equals."

Navigable History: Use arrow keys to select, edit, and reuse any part of your past calculations or results.

Variables & Functions: Assign values to variables (x := 10) and define your own multi-argument functions (f(x, y) := x^2 + y^2) that persist between sessions.

Advanced Math Support: Built-in support for complex numbers (3 + 4i), vectors (vector(1; 2; 3)), and matrices (matrix(1, 2; 3, 4)).

LaTeX Export: Copy any entry from your history as a beautifully formatted LaTeX equation, ready to be pasted into your documents.

Angle Modes: Instantly switch between Degrees (DEG) and Radians (RAD) for trigonometric functions.
Built-in Constants & Symbols: Quick-access popovers for physical constants (like œÄ, c, h) and Greek letters.
